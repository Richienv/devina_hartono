SOP for Styling a Professional Card with Elevated Portrait Image

Objective: To create a professional and visually appealing card design with a portrait image on the left, extending above the main rectangle container. The container has a linear gradient blue border for added emphasis.

1. Main Container Styling

	•	Shape and Size:
	•	Set the main container as a landscape rectangle with a width of 300-400px and a height of 150-200px.
	•	Rounded Corners: Apply a border radius of 10-15px to give a modern, soft edge.
	•	Border:
	•	Use a linear gradient blue for the border to add a polished effect.
	•	Gradient Colors: Start from a lighter blue (e.g., #00AEEF) to a darker blue (e.g., #0066CC).
	•	Border Thickness: 2-4px to make the card’s edge stand out without overwhelming the design.
	•	Background Color:
	•	Set a light or white background within the main container to enhance readability and contrast with the gradient border.

2. Image Styling

	•	Image Placement:
	•	Place a portrait-style image on the left side of the card, partially overlapping the main container.
	•	Image Size: Set the image to a width of approximately 100px and a height of 200-250px, so it extends above and below the container height.
	•	Image Border Radius:
	•	Apply a subtle border radius (5-8px) to the image for a soft, modern look.
	•	Shadow on Image:
	•	Add a subtle shadow effect to create depth:
	•	Shadow Color: #000000 at 15% opacity
	•	Blur: 10-15px
	•	Offset: 0px X-axis, 5px Y-axis.
	•	Ensure the shadow is only applied to the image, enhancing its floating effect over the main container.

3. Content Section Styling (Within Main Container)

	•	Padding and Spacing:
	•	Add 15-20px padding inside the main container for comfortable spacing between the image and text.
	•	Leave additional padding on the right side for balance.
	•	Heading Text:
	•	Place the heading at the top of the content section, using a bold, gradient blue text to match the border.
	•	Font Size: 18-22px for readability, with a weight that complements the container’s overall design.
	•	Description Text:
	•	Add a brief description below the heading in dark gray or black.
	•	Font Size: 14-16px, regular weight for readability, and limit text to 2-4 lines.
	•	Value Tag (Optional):
	•	Place a rounded rectangle “Value” tag at the top-right corner of the container for emphasis.
	•	Background Color: Solid gradient blue matching the border color.
	•	Font: Bold, white text (Font Size: 12-14px) with a label like “VALUE 600JT+ PER YEAR”.

4. Action Button Styling (Optional)

	•	Button Placement:
	•	Place a CTA button (e.g., “Learn More”) at the bottom of the content section within the container.
	•	Button Style:
	•	Background Color: Gradient blue matching the border for consistency.
	•	Text Color: White, bold text (Font Size: 14-16px).
	•	Rounded Corners: Border radius of 5-10px to maintain the card’s soft, modern aesthetic.
	•	Padding: 8-12px to ensure a clickable, comfortable button size.

5. Shadow and Depth Effects

	•	Container Shadow:
	•	Add a soft shadow to the main container to create a floating effect:
	•	Shadow Color: #000000 at 10-15% opacity
	•	Blur: 20-30px, Offset: 0px X-axis, 5px Y-axis.
	•	Highlight on Border:
	•	Apply a subtle inner shadow or glow on the gradient border to give it a slight 3D effect.
	•	Use a light blue overlay (e.g., #00AEEF at 15% opacity) around the border.

6. Final Alignment and Consistency

	•	Alignment:
	•	Ensure that all elements within the card (image, text, and button) are properly aligned and evenly spaced for a balanced appearance.
	•	Contrast and Readability Check:
	•	Check that text is legible against the background and that all gradient elements have sufficient contrast.
	•	Final Review:
	•	Ensure that the image overlap, gradient borders, and shadow effects maintain a professional and clean look across different screens and resolutions.

By following these styling steps, you will achieve a card design with a portrait image extending above a gradient-bordered rectangle container, ensuring a visually professional and engaging appearance. Adjust the specifics based on brand guidelines or platform requirements.
